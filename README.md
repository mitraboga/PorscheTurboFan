## Project Description

This project showcases a detailed 3D model of the iconic Porsche TurboFan wheel, meticulously crafted using Autodesk Fusion 360. The model consists of five separate components:

1. **Michelin Race Car Tire**
2. **TurboFan Rim**
3. **Porsche Hub Cap**
4. **Brake Pad**
5. **Porsche Brake Caliper**

Each component was individually designed and then assembled to create a complete and accurate representation of the TurboFan wheel.

## Components Breakdown

- **Michelin Race Car Tire**: Modeled to replicate the high-performance tire used in professional racing.
- **TurboFan Rim**: Designed to capture the unique aerodynamic and aesthetic features of the TurboFan style.
- **Porsche Hub Cap**: Created with attention to the Porsche branding and design.
- **Brake Pad**: Modeled to fit seamlessly within the wheel assembly, ensuring functional and visual accuracy.
- **Porsche Brake Caliper**: Designed to add to the model's realism and functional accuracy.

## Design and Modeling Tools

In Autodesk Fusion 360, I utilized a variety of tools and features to create and perfect the components of the TurboFan wheel:

- **2D Sketch Dimensioning**: For precise control over the dimensions and geometry of the initial sketches.
- **3D Extrude**: To transform 2D sketches into 3D models by adding depth.
- **Revolve**: Used for creating symmetrical components by revolving a profile around an axis.
- **Pipe**: To create tubular structures, which was essential for parts like the tire treads.
- **Chamfer**: For adding bevelled edges to components, improving both aesthetics and functionality.
- **Fillet**: To smooth out sharp edges and corners, enhancing the visual appeal and strength of the model.

## Appearance and Materials

To enhance the realism and visual quality of the model, I applied various appearance features in Fusion 360:

- **Stainless Steel**: For parts requiring a polished, high-end metallic finish.
- **Aluminum**: To give components a lightweight and sleek appearance.
- **Carbon Fibre**: For adding a high-strength, modern aesthetic to specific parts.
- **Black Metal Flake**: Used for a textured, glossy black finish.
- **Yellow Glossy Paint**: Applied to the Porsche Brake Caliper for the classic Porsche look.
- **Matte Blue Paint**: For a smooth, non-reflective surface on certain components.
- **Red Glossy Paint**: To add a vibrant, eye-catching finish to selected parts.

## Assembly and Animation

Using Fusion 360's built-in animation feature, I created a dynamic showcase of the wheel assembly process. This animation visually demonstrates the step-by-step assembly of all five components, highlighting the precise engineering and design considerations taken during the project. The animation effectively conveys the intricate details and the final integration of each part into the fully assembled TurboFan wheel.

## Tools Used

- **Autodesk Fusion 360**: For designing, modelling, and animating the components and the final assembly.
- **DaVinci Resolve**: For editing the descriptive/explanatory YouTube video.

## Conclusion

This project not only demonstrates advanced mechanical design skills but also the ability to use modern CAD tools to create, assemble, and animate complex models. The Porsche TurboFan wheel model stands as a testament to precision engineering and attention to detail.
